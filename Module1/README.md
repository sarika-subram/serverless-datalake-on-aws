### Learning outcomes from this workshop?
* Design serverless data lake architecture
* Build a data processing pipeline and Data Lake using Amazon S3 for storing data
* Use Amazon Kinesis for real-time streaming data
* Use AWS Glue to automatically catalog datasets
* Run interactive ETL scripts in an Amazon SageMaker Jupyter notebook connected to an AWS Glue development endpoint
* Query data using Amazon Athena & visualize it using Amazon QuickSight

# Pre-requisites:  
* You need to have access to an AWS account with **AdminstratorAccess**
* This lab should be executed in **us-east-1** region
* Best is to **follow links from this  guide** & open them **in new a tab**
* Run this lab in a modern browser
